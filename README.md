# NYC Taxi Trip Analysis & Modeling

This repository contains our groups exploratory data analysis (EDA), regression modeling, classification modeling and analysis for NYC taxi trip data.  
The goal of the project is to understand trip patterns, build predictive models, and evaluate key factors that influence trip outcomes.
